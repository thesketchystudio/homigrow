## Git Workflow — NON-NEGOTIABLE
- Branches: `main` (production) and `dev` (staging). Both are protected —
  PRs required, no direct pushes, no force pushes, no bypass list.
- All work happens on `feature/<phase>-<short-desc>` or `fix/<short-desc>`
  branches cut from `dev`.
- PR into `dev` first. Only promote `dev` → `main` once verified working.
- Never commit directly to `main` or `dev` even for "trivial" fixes.
- Delete feature branches after merge.

## Environment & Secrets
- `.env` files are gitignored. Never commit secrets, ever, under any
  circumstance, even temporarily "to test something."
- Backend config is split into parts (`DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_NAME`,
  `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`) and assembled into `DATABASE_URL` via a
  `@computed_field` in `app/core/config.py` — do not flatten this back into
  a single raw URL env var.
- Naming convention: `DB_*` not `DATABASE_*`. Keep this consistent —
  don't reintroduce the old naming anywhere.
- `ENVIRONMENT` values: `dev` (local/staging) and `production`. This is
  unrelated to the git branch name sharing the same word — don't conflate them.

## API Versioning
All backend routes live under `api/v1/`. This is deliberate — if a response
shape needs a breaking change later, add `api/v2/` alongside it rather than
mutating `v1` under callers that already depend on it. Don't skip the `v1`
prefix on new routes "because it's just one endpoint."

## Coding Standards (apply to every file, no exceptions)

### File headers
Every source file starts with a short comment block stating its purpose:
```python
# app/services/property_lifecycle.py
# Defines the Property status state machine (Draft -> Pending -> Active ->
# Sold/Rented -> Expired -> Rejected) and valid transition rules.
```
```typescript
// components/shared/PropertyCard.tsx
// Reusable property listing card used across homepage, search results,
// saved properties, and broker listings views.
```

### Function-level comments
Every non-trivial function gets a comment block above it explaining *why*,
not just what (the code already shows what):
```python
def transition_property_status(current: str, new: str) -> bool:
    """
    Validates a property status transition against the defined lifecycle.
    Returns False (does not raise) for invalid transitions so callers can
    handle rejection gracefully in the API layer rather than via exception.
    """
```

### Modularity rules
- One responsibility per file. If a file is doing two unrelated things,
  split it.
- Business logic lives in `services/`, never inline in route handlers.
  Routes should read as: validate input → call service → return response.
- Shared frontend components (Nav, Sidebar, Property Card, Table, Modal,
  Toast) are built once in `components/shared/` — never duplicated per
  portal. If a Broker-specific variant is needed, compose/extend the shared
  base rather than copy-pasting it.
- No magic strings for status values, roles, or enums — define them once
  (Python `Enum`, TS `type`/`enum`) and import everywhere.

### Root-cause fixes only
- When something breaks, fix the actual cause, not the symptom. Don't wrap
  a failure in a try/except just to silence it, and don't patch a
  downstream effect if the real bug is upstream.
- If a bug is caused by a wrong assumption elsewhere in the codebase, fix
  that assumption — don't add a special case around it.
- Flag (don't silently paper over) any workaround that's genuinely
  temporary, with a `# TODO:` comment explaining what the real fix is.

### Verification, not assumption
- After scaffolding or wiring anything (DB, Sentry, new endpoint), add a
  temporary verification route/test, confirm it works, then remove the
  temporary code. Don't assume something works because it "should."
- Prefer real tooling (linters, `npm audit`, actual test runs) over
  judgment calls for verifying correctness.

## Current Status (update this section as phases complete)

### ✅ Done
- Repo scaffolded, branching + protection rules set up (`main`, `dev`)
- Frontend: Next.js + Tailwind v4 scaffolded, route groups created
  (`(client)`, `(broker)`, `(admin)`), empty shared component folders in place
- Backend: FastAPI scaffold, `/health` route, config split (`DB_*` vars),
  Supabase Postgres connected (Mumbai region), Sentry wired (Developer tier)

### ⏳ Pending — Phase 1 (Weeks 1–4)
- GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows (frontend + backend)
- Design tokens from Figma into `globals.css` `@theme` block
- Shared components: TopNavBar, Sidebar, Property Card, Modal, Toast, Table
- Core SQLAlchemy models: User, Property, Lead, Message, Notification,
  SavedProperty, Boost/Plan
- Property status lifecycle as an actual enum/state machine (not built yet)
- First Alembic migration
- Upload pipeline architecture (R2 + Stream) design, before endpoints exist

### Known open decisions
- SMS/OTP provider: MSG91 vs Fast2SMS — not yet chosen

## What NOT to do
- Don't run `npm audit fix --force` reflexively on scaffold warnings.
- Don't add Supabase's Data API / auto-expose-tables / RLS — this project
  bypasses Supabase's REST layer entirely; the backend is the only DB client.
- Don't connect Supabase's GitHub schema-sync — Alembic is the single
  source of truth for migrations, no dual systems.
- Don't push directly to `main` or `dev`, ever, regardless of urgency.
